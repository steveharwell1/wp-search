# Feedback Ideas
- Heading Levels B-High U-High: Highlight Inappropriate heading level and give suggestions on fixes.
- Remove useless paragraphs B-Low U-Mid: Remove easy to miss paragraphs with just a single letter in them.
- Dead anchors B-Mid U-Mid: Point out when on-this-page links are broken and list some solutions
- Padding synergy B-low U-mid: Recommend full padding on the side of a section that is connected to a differently colored section. Also recommend padding collapsing between two sections of the same color. 2 gradients should never be next to each other.
- Bottom image padding B-low U-low: Recommend full width images have their bottom padding removed.
